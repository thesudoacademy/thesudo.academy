# Contribution Guidelines

We encourage and welcome contributions from the community! To ensure a smooth and efficient contribution process, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Fork the repository:** Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account. This will allow you to make changes and submit a pull request for review.
2. **Create a branch:** Create a new branch with a descriptive name for your changes. This will help keep your changes separate from the main repository and make it easier to review and merge your changes.
3. **Make your changes:** Make your changes and commit them to your branch. Be sure to write clear, concise commit messages that explain the purpose of your changes.
4. **Test your changes:** Before submitting a pull request, ensure that your changes work as expected and do not introduce new issues.
5. **Submit a pull request:** Once you have made and tested your changes, submit a pull request to the main repository. Be sure to provide a detailed description of your changes and reference any related issues.
6. **Review and feedback:** Be prepared to receive feedback on your pull request. Be open to suggestions and be willing to make additional changes if requested. The maintainers will review your pull request and provide feedback or request changes as necessary.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **the sudo academy**! We look forward to working with you and building a strong, supportive community together.
